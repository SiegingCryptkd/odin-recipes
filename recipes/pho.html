    <h2>What is Pho?</h2>
    <p>Pho is a popular and my personal favorite Vietnamese soup dish <i>(yes... you can call me basic)</i>
        that consists of bone broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat. It can be made from any type of bone 
        (beef, pork, chicken etc) but beef is the most common version. Pho has a clean yet savory,
        delicate taste and has the potential to give you an otherworldly experience. Everytime I eat pho,
        it brings me back to childhood memories of my mom cooking preparing it. The rich smell of all the
        different spices would always make my stomach rumble from hunger! Let's get to prepping the ingredients.
