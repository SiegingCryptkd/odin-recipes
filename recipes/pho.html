    <h2>What is Pho?</h2>
    <p>Pho is a popular and my personal favorite Vietnamese soup dish <i>(yes... you can call me basic)</i>
        that consists of bone broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat. It can be made from any type of bone 
        (beef, pork, chicken etc) but beef is the most common version. Pho has a clean yet savory,
        delicate taste and has the potential to give you an otherworldly experience. Everytime I eat pho,
        it brings me back to childhood memories of my mom cooking preparing it. The rich smell of all the
        different spices would always make my stomach rumble from hunger! Let's get to prepping the ingredients.

    <h2>Steps to Make Pho</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Roast bones and onions</h3><p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the bones on a baking sheet and roast
                in the oven until all are brown (about 1 hour). Place both halves of the cut onion on baking sheet and roast onion
                another rak until blacked and soft (about 45 minutes).
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Make the broth</h3><p>Combine the roasted beef bones and onions, ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and
                water in a large stock pot. Bring to a boil then turn to low heatallow it to simmer for roughly 6 to 10 hours. 
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Soak the rice noodles</h3><p>About 1.5 hours prior to the end of simmering the brother, place the dry rice 
                noodles into a container filled with room temperature water. Let it soak for 1 hour.
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Cook the rice noodles</h3><p>First, fill a small pot with water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, cook
                the rice noodles in the boiling water until the noodles are soft but not too soft to the point they are mushy. 
                Check the texture every 30 seconds to your liking. Drain the cooked noodles and place them in a bowl.
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Plate it!</h3><p>You're on the last stretch! Finally, garnish the bowl of cooked noodles with thinnly cut 
                sirloin, cilantro, green onions, squeezed lime, and other toppings you might want. Once finished, pour some of
                that yummy broth you had simmering into your bowl. The meat will be cooked by the hot soup! If the meat is too
                pink for you, you can cook it to your liking in the broth itself.</p></li>
        </ol>
