    <h2 class="heading">What are Champagne mangos?</h2>
    <p>These yummy, juicy yellow friends are also known as an Ataulfo or honey mangos.
        because of their sweet, creamy, and perky taste. They differ from Brazilian mangos
        due to their texture, taste, and size as they tend to be on the smaller side. 
        If you're looking for something refreshing after a long day, these champagne mangos
        will do the trick! 
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading">Steps to Prep</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Buy ripe mangos!</h3><p>You're probably thinking, "how do I know which
                mangos to pick and which ones are ripe?" Well, once you find a grocery store
                that sells them, you can easily tell they are champagne mangos because of their
                bright yellow color and will not have any hint of red. If they are sold
                individually, you'll want to pick the ones that are super yellow and have a slight
                wrinkle in their skin. Make sure to avoid bruised or damaged ones! However, sometimes
                grocery stores will sell them in packs (most commonly a 12pk). These packages normally
                have unripe mangos in them so if you buy the 12 packs, you'll have to wait until they
                are ripe (about 4-10 days) depending on how unripe they are.
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Wash and cut them</h3><p>Once you have found some ripe mangos, it's prime time!
                Wash them and get a small knife big enough to slice through.
                Here's the <i>tricky</i> part, becareful of where and how you cut the mango! It's
                seed is irregularly shaped so if you've never cut a mango, it will be difficult the
                first few times. So, take the mango and grip it to where it is laying flat in your 
                palm with the stem pointed towards you. While the mango is laying in your palm, cut
                about 1/4th of an inch above the stem. You'll feel the seed as you gently cut through.
                Use the seed's shape as a guide until you've cut that half of the mango off!
                Once you've done that half, don't forget to do the other and the sides as well... you
                don't want to miss out on any of that juicy goodness!
                <p>Once you have your two halves cut, take one of them and place it so the skin is
                    touching your palm. Then press your knife gently on top to slice a checkered
                    pattern into it. Repeat with the other half!
                </p>
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Spread the Checkered cuts!</h3><p>Finally use your fingers and push the side of
                the slices with the skin back to allow for easier access to the juicy yums and enjoy!
            </p></li>
        </ol>
